# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

-Food recommendations to make up for nutrients you are lacking.
-Google/Facebook Integration
### Technologies

### What I'll Have to Learn
The main problem I will have to tackle is pulling data in through a public API and having it sync up with the food choices made by the user. In a similar vein to that I will also have to figure out how to make the program identify what the user is lacking and make appropriate recommendations based on their defieciences. Integrating user's social media accounts into their logins is also a new area for me. Other than those three issues everything else in my project will likely be something that was covered in LC101 or an extension of those topics.
